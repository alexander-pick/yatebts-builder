# YateBTS builder

This project is a build environment for YateBTS. It will pull all sources from the SVN and will build Yate, YateBTS and bladeRF firmware inside a handy docker container. A dockerfile and a script for creating the docker container are included as well. The docker container is configured to allow the use of a SDR connected to the host system and will run the YateBTS webconfig on localhost:80 for convenient use. So it's pretty much a plug and play YateBTS setup for anyone who doesn't want to spend time on getting it going manually. The setup is still suitable for development purpose using the included `build_yate.sh` script to recompile individual components. Fully customize able for advanced users. 

System was tested with a bladeRF x40 and A4 SDRs. The source tags pulled are the one recommended in the YateBTS setup guide.

This is a small project I build after taking the amazing baseband security training by Marius MÃ¼nch and Fabian Freyer at hardwear.io, which took place in The Hauge this year. If you are interested in baseband research I really recommend you their trainings as a kickstart.

*YateBTS builder is the first part of multiple releases aimed to aid baseband research and will be the foundation for the other tools. So stay tuned!*

# Basic Operation

- use `dockerbuild.sh` to build container
- once the container is up use `build_yate.sh --all` to build yatebts and bladeRF with all components.
- use `run_yate.sh` to run yate

If you want to look at the help, use `--help`. There are some advanced options for the scripts:

## build_yate.sh Parameter

> 		Possible parameter1:
>         --help          display this help
>         --all           cleans, downloads and build all components - yate, yatebts and bladerf (recommended for a first run)
>         --download      downloads the required sources
>         --rebuild-yate  rebuilds yate
>         --rebuild-yatebts       rebuilds yatebts
>         --rebuild-core  rebuilds yate and yatebts
>         --rebuild-bladerf       rebuilds bladerf
>         --web           redo the web setup (port 80 webpanel)
>         --clean         clean all external sources (WARNING: deletes all currently present sources!)
> 		Possible parameter2:
>         --quick         quick build, without configure or clean

## run_yate.sh Parameter

>        --help   display this help
>        --pcap   capture a pcap of the GSM traffic via GSMtap*
>        --x40    flash bladeRF x40 before starting
>        --a4     flash bladeRF A4 before starting
>        * requrires GSMTAP to be enabled (in webpanel)

# YateBTS Settings

YateBTS comes with a web panel which can be accessed at `http://localhost/nipc/`. Apache will inside docker will run at port 80 by default. If your port 80 is already in used adjust the port in `dockerbuild.sh`. Reconfigure the dockerfile if you want to use another port at localhost.

# Troubleshooting

Here are some solutions for problems I encountered during my journey with YateBTS:

**Ahead of time errors**
Restart Docker. These errors are sometimes combined with some IOCTL errors which are hard to spot and happen after Yate crashed once.

**Port 80 already in use**
If port 80 is in use on your host adjust the port in dockerbuild.sh

**Weird burst error**
Move the phone away from the SDR antennas, check for timing issues on the host.

**ADB disconnecting inside cage**
Move the phone away from the SDR antennas, use better USB cables.
